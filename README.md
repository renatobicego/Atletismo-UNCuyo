Atletismo UNCuyo
IÂ´m Renato Bicego, an athlete from Universidad Nacional de Cuyo. In this project, I wanted to
use all my knowledge learned in this course to develop a website to my track and field team,
to facilitate access to media content and competitions information, and also invite people to join us. 

What I focused on this proyect was developing a friendly, well-designed and easy-to-interact website.
I spent most of the time working on CSS, and thus achieve an elegant and beautiful website for each 
device it was visited.

To run this application: 
    Directory: capstone/atletismo

    python manage.py runserver
